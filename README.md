# About thesis
The main goal was to create simple restful web service using  with both android and desktop client (written obviously in Java) and then try to secure it with user authentication, user authorization and transmission's encryption. Application allows users to control their finances. 

As now we're engineers, this project has finally ended. It was important lesson for us. Some things works other not necessarily, but overall it was great journey (except the fact I (Fifuch) still haven't got good finance manager).
